# Research Techniques Project
This repository includes the Matlab code, results and commentary for the SPS4050: Research Techniques course Fall 2021. It was contributed to by:
- Alexandra Cabal
- Joe Evans
- Maxine Khumalo
- Laura Zamora

Our process work, including the live scripts submitted for the milstones are enclosed in a folder called process work.

To test the code, run the Unit test live script. It follows our investigative process using a single star. This work could be extended to the other stars with data available in the process work. 

The Process work code can be found in Project_v1. It includes the dated Milestones and the code used to generate results for the table and graphs in the final paper.
